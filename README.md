**Identifying Drivers of Employee Attrition for Strategic Retention Planning**

## 📝 Problem Statement
Employee attrition leads to high recruitment costs, workflow disruptions, and loss of valuable talent. HR departments often lack visibility into the key drivers of attrition, resulting in reactive rather than proactive retention strategies.

- Segment at-risk employee groups  
- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard  
- Provide data-driven recommendations to support HR decision-making
