# 🧑‍💼 Employee Attrition Analysis – Power BI Project

## 📌 Project Title
**Identifying Drivers of Employee Attrition for Strategic Retention Planning**

## 📝 Problem Statement
Employee attrition leads to high recruitment costs, workflow disruptions, and loss of valuable talent. HR departments often lack visibility into the key drivers of attrition, resulting in reactive rather than proactive retention strategies.

This project analyses employee demographics, performance, and satisfaction data using SQL and Power BI to uncover trends, identify at-risk groups, and provide actionable insights for improving employee retention.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify key factors influencing employee attrition  
- Segment at-risk employee groups  
- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard  
- Provide data-driven recommendations to support HR decision-making

## 🗂️ Dataset
- **Source**: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance (via Kaggle)  
- **Attributes include**:
  - Employee demographics (age, gender, education)
  - Job role, department, and income
  - Performance ratings and work-life balance
  - Attrition status (target variable)

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** – Data modelling and interactive visualisations  
- **Measures** - Some use of measures to calculate Attrition Rate and creating of a custom column for the Weighted Satisfaction Score.

## 💭 Reflections
- When dealing with humans, the biggest mistake is assuming they behave the same.
- Satisfaction score for different departments might be differ as different job roles have different problems.
